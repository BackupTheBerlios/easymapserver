EasyMapServer is a shell script that gets sources of PHP4, GDAL 
and MapServer. Then it compiles it to produce a php executable
for use with apache configuration in misc/apache.conf.
Compilation also produces a file named php_mapscript.so
that will be used by that php application.

Please edit easymapserver.sh and change values if needed 
and then execute it ! (no mercy)

See INSTALL file for more information
