EasyMapServer
==============

EasyMapServer is an installer script for Mapserver, to be used with
Localis (http://localis.org). 

Written in plain shell, its main actions are :
- use wget to download the sources in src/directory
- compile gdal, php4 and mapserver with correct options

Actually the real pure knowledge is on
http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?PHPMapScript
and this script should only be useful is some specific 
environment, especially GNU/Linux with debian sid, when you 
repeatedly install mapservers everywhere (which is good!).


Pre-requisite
==============

- that script is written for a Linux computer (debian, mainly)
		
- libpng2 (debian package has same name)

- GD library 1.2 (libgd1 libgd-dev)

- Jpeg library _optional_ (libjpeg62-dev)

- Freetype library 2 (libfreetype6-dev)

- libcurl is used by WMS client

- proj4 is very useful when working in maps and projections
	

Content of EasyMapServer install
=================================

- PHP v4.3.7
	from http://fr.php.net

- MAPSERVER v4.2.1
  from http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu
	
- GDAL v1.2.1
  from http://remotesensing.org


Executing EasyMapServer : installation process
================================================

** YOU MUST BE ROOT TO PERFORM THIS INSTALLATION **

To make it short, the shell script easymapserver.sh will wget 
sources, will configure and make all the sources with a sample 
set of compilation options that you should tune up to your taste.

You should also change the urls for wget, as they are optimized 
for french users.

When tuned (or not) you can just launch the script

    ./easymapserver.sh

(Usually there are some libs lacking, you may want to use auto-apt)

You need to activate mod_action in apache. 
Uncomment this line into your apache configuration file (httpd.conf):

    #LoadModule action_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_actions.so


Add this line into your http.conf:

    Include your_install_dir/conf/mapserv.conf
